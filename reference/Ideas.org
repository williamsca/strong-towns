* Infrastructure/Local Finances/Sprawl

*Question:* do tax revenues from new development subsidize the infrastructure maintenance costs of current residents?

*Model sketch:*
- Local politicians assess "impact fees" on new developments that fund the construction costs of new roads, sewerage, etc.
- New development is revenue positive: it enlarges the tax base without raising expenditures by much
- Politician (and voters) are myopic, and do not consider financial impact of future maintenance obligations
- Politician can increase probability of re-election by driving down tax rates by approving lots of new development
