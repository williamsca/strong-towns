For FY 2005 and later, code coverage was standardized. A brief summary of the changes:
- Many tax codes which formerly applied only to states now apply to local governments. These revenues associated with these codes were previously associated with "all other" tax codes.
- Certain non-tax revenue codes are now collected for local governments
- Expenditures for toll highways (45), police protection (62) and misc. commercial activities (03) are now collected for local governments
- Certain debt categories are no longer collected. Only certain total variables are comparable to previous years.
