# strong-towns

Document the relationship between local government finances and the proliferation of suburbs.

## Next steps
- Write down a model in line with Glaeser and Ponzetto (2014) to explain why cities with more transient populations might favor development
- Explore the idea that development is a substitute for borrowing money. If interest rates increase, do localities approve more building?

## TODO
- Address variation in county areas over time
- Merge historic ASSLG finance data with contemporary surveys?


## DONE
- Replicate US Census 2019 Summary (".../reference/alfin_summary_brief.pdf")
- Review Survey Methodology
-- https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/gus/technical-documentation/methodology.html
- Regress current operational expenditure on lagged capital outlays
- Merge in 2007 and 2012 expenditure data
- What share of local tax revenue is spent on highway construction + operations?
